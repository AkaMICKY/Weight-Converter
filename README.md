# ⚖️ Weight Converter (Kg <=> Lbs)

## 📌 Description  
A simple console application that asks for the user's weight in **kilograms (kg)** and converts it into **pounds (lbs)**.  
It’s a small but practical project to practice basic input, conversion, and output in C#.  

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/AkaMicky/WeightConverter.git`  
2. Open it in your favorite IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).  
3. Run the program. 🚀  

## ▶️ Usage  
- Enter your weight in **kilograms**.  
- The program will calculate and display your weight in **pounds**.  
- Example:  
  - Input: `50`  
  - Output: `Your weight in pounds is 110.23`  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Add reverse conversion (**lbs <=> kg**).  
- Use `TryParse` to handle invalid inputs gracefully.  
- Add support for more units (stones, ounces, etc.).  

## 📚 What I Learned  
- Converting `string` inputs to numbers for calculations.  
- Using `Math.Round()` to make results cleaner.  
- Building and testing a simple but useful C# console app.
